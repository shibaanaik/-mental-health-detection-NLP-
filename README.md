# Mental health detection using NLP

# Project Overview

Mental health issues are often expressed through language patterns in social media posts, chats, and blogs. By analyzing text, NLP can help identify early signs of distress.

This project is an application of text classification, which is closely related to:

Sentiment Analysis â€“ identifying whether a text is positive, negative, or neutral.

Emotion Detection â€“ finding emotions like joy, anger, sadness, etc.

Mental Health Detection â€“ identifying psychological distress categories (focus of this project).

ðŸ‘‰ Here, the system takes raw text input, cleans it, extracts meaningful features, and predicts the mental health condition category, and also predict percentage of mental condition .


A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that detects mental health conditions from social media posts.
The model classifies text into five categories:

*ðŸŸ¦ Stress

*ðŸŸ¨ Depression

*ðŸŸ© Bipolar disorder

*ðŸŸ¥ Personality disorder

*ðŸŸª Anxiety

This project uses TF-IDF + Random Forest to achieve high accuracy and is deployed as a Streamlit web app.

# Installation & Setup
## 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mental-Health-Detection.git
cd Mental-Health-Detection

## Create environment (recommended with conda)
conda create -n mentalhealth python=3.10 -y
conda activate mentalhealth

# Model Performance

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: ~82%

Macro F1-score: 0.82

# Future Improvements

Use deep learning models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) for higher accuracy

Handle class imbalance better (SMOTE or weighted loss)

Add explainability (SHAP/LIME)

Deploy on cloud platforms (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces)
